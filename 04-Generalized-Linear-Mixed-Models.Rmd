- rr2: R2s for Regression Models

Three methods to calculate R2 for models with correlated errors, including Phylogenetic GLS, Phylogenetic Logistic Regression, Linear Mixed Models (LMMs), and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). See details in Ives 2018 <doi:10.1093/sysbio/syy060>.

- cAIC4: Conditional Akaike Information Criterion for 'lme4'

Provides functions for the estimation of the conditional Akaike information in generalized mixed-effect models fitted with (g)lmer() from 'lme4'.

- lme4: Linear Mixed-Effects Models using 'Eigen' and S4

Fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models. The models and their components are represented using S4 classes and methods. The core computational algorithms are implemented using the 'Eigen' C++ library for numerical linear algebra and 'RcppEigen' "glue".

- glmmTMB: Generalized Linear Mixed Models using Template Model Builder

Fit linear and generalized linear mixed models with various extensions, including zero-inflation. The models are fitted using maximum likelihood estimation via 'TMB' (Template Model Builder). Random effects are assumed to be Gaussian on the scale of the linear predictor and are integrated out using the Laplace approximation. Gradients are calculated using automatic differentiation.

- gllvm: Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models

Generalized linear latent variable model (gllvm) for analyzing multivariate data. Estimation is performed using either Laplace approximation or variational approximation method implemented via TMB

- FENmlm: Fixed Effects Nonlinear Maximum Likelihood Models

Efficient estimation of maximum likelihood models with multiple fixed-effects. Standard-errors can easily and flexibly be clustered and estimations exported [@Laurent_2018_Efficient].

- ggeffects: Tidy Data Frames of Marginal Effects for ggplot2

Compute marginal effects from statistical models and returns the result as tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to use with the 'ggplot2'-package. Marginal effects can be calculated for many different models. Interaction terms, splines and polynomial terms are also supported. The two main functions are ggpredict() and ggeffect(). There is a generic plot()-method to plot the results using 'ggplot2'.

- broom: Convert Statistical Analysis Objects into Tidy Tibbles

Summarizes key information about statistical objects in tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each provide different types of information about a model. tidy() summarizes information about model components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about individual observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or influence measures.

- DHARMa: Diagnostics for HierArchical Regession Models

https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa

The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable scaled (quantile) residuals for fitted generalized linear mixed models. Currently supported are generalized linear mixed models from 'lme4' (classes 'lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), generalized additive models ('gam' from 'mgcv'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model classes. Alternatively, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression. The package also provides a number of plot and test functions for typical model misspecification problems, such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and residual spatial and temporal autocorrelation.
