## Data Visualization & Dashboard

### DESCRIZIONE

Discover how to tell the story that lives in your data: using the most modern R tools for data visualization, learn how to build beautiful, effective and flexible plots. Then, step by step, discover how to embed visualizations and tables in a powerful Shinyapp, to make your data easily navigable and let their insights emerge.

### Course organization

The first day opens with a brief review of the graphic environment in R and of standard plots. It will then present the ggplot grammar of graphics, a grammar for creating nice and beautiful graphs.
First, we provide the tools for building the most important kinds of plot: Scatter Plot, Line Plot, Histogram, Bar Plot, Box Plot, Surface Plot. Secondly, the course illustrates the advanced features of ggplot2 to deal with the most common plot customization questions: axes customisation, titles and legends, etc etc, as well as an overview of the ggplot family.
During the second day you will learn about dashboards and interactive graphics with Shiny. Once the basics to understand the structure of a shiny dashboard are introduced, you will learn how to build a shiny dashboard from scratch using data provided by the instructor. Step by step you will be adding complexity to your dashboard so that you can fully tell the story behind the data.

### Outline

 ggplot2 grammar

- Creating plots with ggplot (Scatter Plot, Line Plot, Bar Plot, Histogram, Box Plot, Surface Plot)
- Customizing Plots (aesthetics, legend, axes, faceting and themes)
- Specialised visualisation tools: ggmap and ggally
- Basic shiny concepts
- The structure of a shiny app
- Shiny: the server side and the user side
- Understanding reactivity in shiny
- An overview of html widgets


## R with Database & Big Data


### DESCRIZIONE

This course presents the latest techniques to work with big data within the R environment. This means manipulating, analysing, visualizing big data structures that exceed the single computer capacity in a true R
style. The large amount of data available nowadays is a tangled and hidden source of knowledge. Being able to quickly and effectively unravel high value information from the vastness of data is the most powerful driver for success in this modern competitive market.
During this course you will become familiar with the basic IT infrastructures behind big data, the R toolbox to access and manipulate big data structures, the sparkML libraries for out of memory data modeling and ad hoc techniques for big data visualization.

### Course organization

During the first day you will focus on accessing and manipulating databases. First, you will be given an introduction to databases and you will be given the details for connecting with them through R.
Then you will be provided with the tools for manipulating data. More specifically, you will focus on the tools supplied in the tidyverse such as dplyr and tidyr.
The second day is dedicated to distributed infrastructure. Again, after an introduction to distributed systems, such as Spark and Hadoop, you will learn how to deal with them through the tools provided by R.
You will also learn about the sparkML libraries for out of memory data modeling and ad hoc techniques for big data visualization.

### Outline

- Introduction to databases
- Connecting databases through R: ODBC and RSQLite
- Data manipulation with dplyr
- Using dplyr with databases
- Introduction to distributed infrastructure
- Spark and Hadoop
- Sparklyr
- Distributed data manipulation with dplyr
- SparkML

### 举例

作为学习的基础看看 dplyr 和 forcats 如何实现 SQL 语句查询

- forcats 即 Tools for Working with Categorical Variables (Factors) 是专门处理分类数据的，常用函数 `fct_reorder`

```r
> ls('package:forcats')
 [1] "%>%"             "as_factor"       "fct_anon"        "fct_c"          
 [5] "fct_collapse"    "fct_count"       "fct_drop"        "fct_expand"     
 [9] "fct_explicit_na" "fct_infreq"      "fct_inorder"     "fct_lump"       
[13] "fct_other"       "fct_recode"      "fct_relabel"     "fct_relevel"    
[17] "fct_reorder"     "fct_reorder2"    "fct_rev"         "fct_shift"      
[21] "fct_shuffle"     "fct_unify"       "fct_unique"      "gss_cat"        
[25] "lvls_expand"     "lvls_reorder"    "lvls_revalue"    "lvls_union"     
```

gapminder 人口统计数据集 因 Hans Rosling’s TED 演讲而著名.

```r
library(gapminder)  # 加载数据集
gapminder
```

- 工具 dplyr 和 forcats
- 目标 Which countries had the fastest growing GDP’s between 1952 and 2007? 看看哪个国家在1952-2007之间GDP增长最快

```r
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(start = first(gdp), end = last(gdp)) %>% 
  mutate(cagr = ((end/start) ^ (1 / 55) - 1) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cagr)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(country, cagr), y = cagr)) +
    labs(x = "Country", y = "Cumulative Annual Growth Rate in GDP (1952-2007)") +
    coord_flip()
```

```r
ls('package:dplyr') %>% length
```

共236个函数，包含上述材料未包含的 join union 等比较复杂的SQL操作

```r
grep('join',ls('package:dplyr'),value = T)
[1] "anti_join"     "full_join"     "inner_join"    "left_join"     "right_join"

## Professional R Programming

### DESCRIZIONE

If you wish to move forward from being a R user to become a R developer, it's time to take your programming skills to the next level. This course will give you an inner perspective of R working mechanisms, as well as tools for addressing your code's issues and to make it more efficient. Once these concepts are established, whether you work alone or in team, it is very important that your code is reproducible. You will learn how to create R packages and use them as the fundamental unit of reproducible R code.

### Course organization

During the first day you will quickly review the basic R objects followed by an explanation of more advanced R objects, such as environments, expression and calls. You will then analyze in details functions objects along with their structures with a focus on code clarity and style.
R as a functional programming language including the use of functionals and the purrr package will close the first day.
The second day will confront many topics. You will learn how to exploit modern computer architecture by learning about parallel computation. Furthermore, you will learn about efficient programming tools: testing, debugging and profiling. The course closes up with the explanation of R packages as a unit of reproducible code where you can include documentation and tests.

### Outline

- Base Programming: environments, functions and loops 
- Functionals in base R
- The purrr package
- Code style and clarity
- Profiling
- Parallel computation
- Testing and debugging
- Documenting your code: rmarkdown
- Sharing your code: github
