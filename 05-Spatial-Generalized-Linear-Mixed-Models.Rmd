广义可加混合效应模型 Generalized additive (mixed) models

- Repo for tutorial/paper on mixed-effect GAMs (General Additive Models with Mixed-Effect Smooths) <https://github.com/noamross/mixed-effect-gams>

- gamm4: Generalized Additive Mixed Models using 'mgcv' and 'lme4'

Estimate generalized additive mixed models via a version of function gamm() from 'mgcv', using 'lme4' for estimation.

- mgcv: Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness Estimation

Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their extensions and other generalized ridge regression with multiple smoothing parameter estimation by (Restricted) Marginal Likelihood, Generalized Cross Validation and similar. Includes a gam() function, a wide variety of smoothers, JAGS support and distributions beyond the exponential family.
