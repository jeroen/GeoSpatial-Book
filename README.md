- CAST: 'caret' Applications for Spatial-Temporal Models

Supporting functionality to run 'caret' with spatial or spatial-temporal data. 'caret' is a frequently used package for model training and prediction using machine learning. This package includes functions to improve spatial-temporal modelling tasks using 'caret'. It prepares data for Leave-Location-Out and Leave-Time-Out cross-validation which are target-oriented validation strategies for spatial-temporal models. To decrease overfitting and improve model performances, the package implements a forward feature selection that selects suitable predictor variables in view to their contribution to the target-oriented performance.

- spaMM: Mixed-Effect Models, Particularly Spatial Models

https://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/~rousset/spaMM.htm

Inference based on mixed-effect models, including generalized linear mixed models with spatial correlations and models with non-Gaussian random effects (e.g., Beta). Variation in residual variance (heteroscedasticity) can itself be represented by a generalized linear mixed model. Various approximations of likelihood or restricted likelihood are implemented, in particular h-likelihood (Lee and Nelder 2001 <doi:10.1093/biomet/88.4.987>) and Laplace approximation.

解有理矩阵方程与高斯过程回归模型可能有关

- FastGP: Efficiently Using Gaussian Processes with Rcpp and RcppEigen

Contains Rcpp and RcppEigen implementations of matrix operations useful for Gaussian process models, such as the inversion of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix, sampling from multivariate normal distributions, evaluation of the log-density of a multivariate normal vector, and Bayesian inference for latent variable Gaussian process models with elliptical slice sampling (Murray, Adams, and MacKay 2010).

- sgeostat: An Object-Oriented Framework for Geostatistical Modeling in S+

An Object-oriented Framework for Geostatistical Modeling in S+ containing functions for variogram estimation, variogram fitting and kriging as well as some plot functions. Written entirely in S, therefore works only for small data sets in acceptable computing time.

- sparseLTSEigen: RcppEigen back end for sparse least trimmed squares regression

Use RcppEigen to fit least trimmed squares regression models with an L1 penalty in order to obtain sparse models.

- LaplacesDemon: Complete Environment for Bayesian Inference
Provides a complete environment for Bayesian inference using a variety of different samplers (see ?LaplacesDemon for an overview). The README describes the history of the package development process.
